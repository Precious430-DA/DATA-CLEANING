# 🧹 Data Cleaning & Regional Sales Analysis Project

## 📌 Objective
The goal of this project was to clean and analyze a sales dataset by performing essential data preparation tasks and generating useful insights through basic exploratory data analysis. The exercise aimed to reinforce fundamental data cleaning techniques and strengthen data summarization skills.

## 🧾 Tasks Performed

### ✅ Removed Duplicate IDs
Checked for and eliminated duplicate rows based on the unique ID column to ensure data integrity.

### ✅ Handled Infinite Values
Identified and removed rows containing infinite (`inf`) values in the `Price Per Unit` column, which could distort analytical outcomes.

### ✅ Conducted Regional Analysis
Computed the following metrics per region:
- Total Quantity Sold  
- Total Sales Value (`Quantity × Price Per Unit`)  

Created a clean, structured summary table showing regional performance.

  A table summarizing:
  - Total quantity sold per region  
  - Total value of sales per region

- **Analysis Report**  
  A brief write-up documenting:
  - Data cleaning steps  
  - Analytical methods used  
  - Key insights drawn from the regional sales performance


## 🧠 Key Insights

- Regions with higher sales value did not always have the highest quantity sold, highlighting price variations across different regions.
- Cleaning steps significantly improved data quality, ensuring more accurate analysis and decision-making potential.
